# goboard-js
After learning basic JS from the first few chapters of Eloquent Javascript, this was one of the first projects I started. Poor choices were made from the beginning (e.g., using HTML5 Canvas rather than SVG), as a result of which the program remains unfinished, and will remain so.

# What works?
The go board canvas is clickable, and white and black can lay down "stones" in turn.

# What doesn't work?
