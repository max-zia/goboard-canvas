# goboard-js
After learning basic JS from the first few chapters of Eloquent Javascript, this was one of the first projects I started. Poor choices were made from the beginning (e.g., using HTML5 Canvas rather than SVG), as a result of which the program remains unfinished, and will remain so.

### What works?
The go board canvas is clickable, and white and black can lay down "stones" in turn.

### What doesn't work?
Just about everything else. Captures, passing, scoring, and so on.

## Plans for the future
This was a valuable learning experience to familiarise myself with the kind of things you can do with JS and HTML5 canvas. My aim is to create a functioning go board using HTML5 SVG and JS, which I will allow two players to play moves on over the Internet with Django Channels.
